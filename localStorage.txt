localStorage is the HTML5 Feature used to store data in 
key value pair format.

JS provides a global object called localStorage, using this, 
we can call utilities of local storage.


note : keys must be unique and string and values can be of any type 
but it gets stored as string only.

setItem(key,value): This function is used to set an item (key,value)
to the localStorage. if the key already exists, then the value 
attached with the key will be overwritten.

getItem(key): This function is used to get an item based on  the 
key provided.

ex:

<html>
    <head>

    </head>
    
    <body>

        <script>
            var value={"xyz":"zyz"};
            //localStorage.setItem('comment',JSON.stringify(value));

            console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('comment')));

        </script>

    </body>

</html>
